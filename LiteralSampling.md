# Literal Sampling

## TODO

- [ ] remove use of vector-sized and related dependencies -- its not worth it now that I have a good idea of what I'm doing
  - this will require explicit nVars included in some places probably
- [ ] make sure to use the `SamplingM` monad basically everywhere -- so that you can reasonably throw errors without causing a crash
