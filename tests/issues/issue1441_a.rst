This is an RTS document.  Here is some code:

.. code:: cryptol

  f1 = 0x01

Now we are back to text.  Here is some more code, this one with options:

.. code:: cryptol
  :linenos:

  f2 = 0x02

Back to text.  Now two code blocks together:

.. code:: cryptol

  f3 = 0x03
.. code:: cryptol
  :linenos:

  f4 = 0x4
