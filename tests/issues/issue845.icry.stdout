    in the definition of 'Main::rfrac', at issue845.cry:2:1--2:6,
    we need to show that
      for any type m, n
      the following constraints hold:
        • fin n
            arising from
            use of expression fraction
            at issue845.cry:2:9--2:17
        • fin m
            arising from
            use of expression fraction
            at issue845.cry:2:9--2:17
        • n >= 1
            arising from
            use of expression fraction
